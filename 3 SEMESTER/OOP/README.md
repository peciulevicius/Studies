# Object-Oriented Programming
Object Oriented college tasks with Java

### TASK1
***Task description:***
> Create class Rectangle with attributes of length, width and top-left corner coordinate (x, y), and, methods that returns:
> - rectangle area size;
> - rectangle perimeter;
> - diagonal length;
> - diagonals crossing point coordinate.

### TASK2
***Task description:***
> Create software that calculates student's grades wighted average.
> - Software must allow user to enter student data (name, surname, group) and the subjects (title, grade, credit points) using keyboard as input source.
> - Software must output whole student information and his grades weighted average value.

### TASK3
***Task description:***
> Create software with Graphical User Interface, for managing academic data - groups, students grades.
> - Software must allow to input new students group (title, semester number), to assign subjects (title, number of credits) and students (name, surname) to particular group.
> - Software must allow to enter grades for selected student and subject.
> - Software must calculate and return students grades average value.
> - Software must calculate and return group's grades average value.
> - Software must return students Top 3 in average, within the selected group.

### TASK4
***Task description:***
> Create GUI-based software, helping the waitress to process restaurant clients' orders. Initial data (information about each dish) is stored in a database, and includes the following:
> - dish name
> - price (without VAT)
> - dish description
> - picture

> **Functional requirements:**
> - Restaurant clients must be able to look around in a menu with all dish information displayed.
> - A client must be able to see and modify his or her orders basket.
> - The total sum of orders basket must be calculated automatically on basket update.
> - After the order is placed, the software must generate the bill with order date, list of ordered items (name, amount, price), total sum with and without VAT.

### TASK5
***Task description:***
> Create software - assignment No. 4 upgrade with the main features as follows:
> - Restaurant administration environment for editing menu (categories, dishes);
> - Order information saving to DB and a file as a backup medium.

> **Additional requirements:**
> - Orders basket must be designed as separate class object;
> - Orders basket information (content and total sum) must be displayed in real-time using events (C#) or interfaces (Java);
> - Order information saving operation must be implemented via Dependency Inversion principle;

### Second Programming Practice
***Task description:***
> Create the e-commerce system having three subsystems:
> - External data storage
> - Client-side (customer application)
> - Owner-side (business owner application to manage items on sale, track purchases)

> Client-side should allow users to register themselves, login and purchase items. Clients also can choose an option for purchased item to be delivered to selected address (with additional charges).

> Owner-side should allow owner to add new items, modify the amount of items having in a store, apply discounts for active buyers (free shipping, discount for next purchase). Also, to see the most active buyers by amount of made purchases and amount of spent money, and to see the mostly bought items.
